## Equity Fundamentals

### Types of Equity

| Type | What It Is | Tax Implications |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Stock Options (ISO/NSO)** | Right to buy shares at strike price | Taxed at exercise or sale |
| **RSUs** | Shares granted outright | Taxed as income when vested |
| **Phantom Shares** | Cash bonus tied to share value | Taxed as income |
| **VSOP (Germany)** | Virtual stock option program | Taxed at payout |

### Vesting Schedule

Standard: **4-year vesting with 1-year cliff**

```
Year 0-1: 0% vested (cliff period)
Year 1:   25% vests (cliff)
Year 2:   50% total
Year 3:   75% total
Year 4:   100% vested
```

### Key Questions to Ask

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "What's the current valuation?" | Determines share value |
| "How many shares outstanding?" | Your % ownership |
| "What's the strike price?" | Cost to exercise |
| "What's the vesting schedule?" | When you actually own it |
| "What happens on exit?" | Liquidation preferences |
| "Is there a refresh program?" | Future grants |
| "What's the exercise window if I leave?" | Usually 90 days, negotiate for longer |

### Equity Valuation Framework

```
Your equity value = (Shares × Price per share) - Exercise cost

Example:
- 10,000 options at €1 strike
- Current valuation: €10/share
- Paper value: 10,000 × €10 = €100,000
- Exercise cost: 10,000 × €1 = €10,000
- Net value: €90,000 (if company exits at current valuation)
```

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Won't share cap table | Hiding dilution |
| No 409A valuation | Unorganized or very early |
| Single trigger acceleration only | Less protection |
| 90-day exercise window | Forces early decision if you leave |
| No anti-dilution protection | Future rounds reduce your % |

## Contract Terms to Negotiate

### Must-Have Clauses

| Clause | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Role & Title** | Written, matches discussion |
| **Base Salary** | Amount, currency, payment schedule |
| **Equity** | Shares, vesting, strike price, exercise window |
| **Bonus** | Target %, criteria, timing |
| **Probation** | Length, notice period during |
| **Notice Period** | Yours and theirs (symmetry) |

### Nice-to-Have Clauses

| Clause | Negotiation Point |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Signing Bonus** | Offset for leaving current equity |
| **Relocation** | If applicable |
| **Remote Work** | Explicit policy |
| **Equipment Budget** | Laptop, home office |
| **Learning Budget** | Conferences, courses |
| **Accelerated Vesting** | On acquisition (double trigger) |

### Watch Out For

| Clause | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Non-compete** | Duration, geography, scope |
| **IP Assignment** | Covers all work, even personal? |
| **Clawback** | When can they take back equity? |
| **Arbitration** | Limits legal options |
| **Unilateral changes** | Can they change terms? |

## Negotiation Strategy

### The Framework

```
1. ANCHOR HIGH
   Start 10-15% above your target

2. JUSTIFY WITH VALUE
   Connect to specific contributions

3. PACKAGE DEAL
   Trade across salary, equity, bonus

4. GET IT IN WRITING
   Verbal offers aren't offers
```

### Sample Scripts

#### Opening (After They Make Offer)

> "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about this opportunity. Based on my research and the value I'd bring—particularly my domain expertise and governance experience—I was targeting [X] for base salary with [Y]% equity. Can we discuss how to get there?"

#### If They Push Back on Salary

> "I understand budget constraints. Could we look at this as a package? I'd be open to a lower base if we can increase the equity component, or add a signing bonus to bridge the gap."

#### If They Push Back on Equity

> "I'm joining at an early stage and taking on significant risk. The equity component is important to me. Could we discuss a larger grant with accelerated vesting, or a refresh program after year one?"

#### If They Say "Non-Negotiable"

> "I appreciate the transparency. What flexibility do we have on [other component—bonus, start date, title, remote policy]?"

### Timing Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Negotiate after offer, before acceptance | Negotiate too early (shows you're not interested in role) |
| Ask for time to consider | Accept on the spot |
| Get everything in writing | Rely on verbal promises |
| Negotiate all components together | Nickel and dime one item at a time |

## Scenario Planning

### If Base is Low, Equity is High

**Startup offer pattern.** Calculate:
- Can you live on the base?
- What's realistic exit timeline?
- What's equity worth at various valuations?

| Exit Valuation | Your 0.5% Worth |
|----------------|-----------------|
| €10M | €50K |
| €50M | €250K |
| €100M | €500K |
| €500M | €2.5M |

**Ask:** "What's your funding runway and path to next round?"

### If Base is High, Equity is Low

**Established company pattern.** Consider:
- Is equity meaningful at their stage?
- Is RSU vs options?
- What's liquidity timeline?

**Ask:** "Is there a refresh program or performance-based grants?"

### If They Won't Budge

Options:
1. Accept and revisit at review
2. Negotiate other terms (title, scope, flexibility)
3. Walk away (have alternatives)

**Ask:** "When is the first compensation review, and what would trigger an adjustment?"

---

## Your Walk-Away Number

Define this **before** negotiating:

| Component | Minimum | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Base Salary** | €___K | Living expenses + savings target |
| **Equity** | ___% | Meaningful upside participation |
| **Total Comp** | €___K | Market rate for your level |

**If offer is below walk-away:** Thank them, decline professionally, keep door open.
