## The Decision Triangle

```
                           EXTERNAL POSITION
                         (What You Ask Max)
                                 /\
                                /  \
                               /    \
                              /      \
                             /  ZOPA  \
                            /  (Deal   \
                           /   Zone)    \
                          /              \
                         /________________\
          INTERNAL NEEDS                    ASSET LEVERAGE
       (What You Require)              (OutrePilot/Outrepreneur)
```

**The Core Logic:**
- Your **Internal Needs** set the floor (walk-away point)
- Your **Asset Leverage** justifies the ceiling (maximum ask)
- Your **External Position** should be between floor and ceiling
- **ZOPA** (Zone of Possible Agreement) is where your range overlaps with Max's

---

## Dimension 1: Internal Needs (The Floor)

### Financial Reality Check

| Need | Monthly | Annual | Justification |
|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Minimum livable | €4,000 | €48,000 | Absolute floor |
| Comfortable | €5,500 | €66,000 | Market junior-mid |
| Target | €6,500 | €78,000 | Your value |
| Ideal | €7,500 | €90,000 | Market senior |

### Risk Tolerance Assessment

| Question | Your Answer | Implication |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you survive 12 months at €48k? | ? | Determines if Model A is viable |
| Do you have savings/runway? | ? | Affects risk tolerance |
| Do you have other offers? | ? | Strengthens BATNA |
| Is this your only option? | ? | If yes, weaker position |

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

| Requirement | Why | Walk Away If... |
|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Written equity agreement | Protection | "We'll figure it out later" |
| Clear Bad Leaver definition | Protection | "Performance" as trigger |
| CTO path clarity | Career | Vague or non-committal |
| Minimum €65k + 8% | Value | Below this threshold |

---

## Dimension 2: Asset Leverage (The Ceiling)

### Asset Inventory

| Asset | Maturity | Unique? | Quantified Value |
|-------|----------|---------|------------------|
| **OutrePilot** | 92% ready | YES | €75-150k replacement cost |
| **OutreRalph** | Production | YES | 10x faster delivery |
| **Outrepreneur** | 92% ready | YES | Full SME platform |
| **Quality Gates** | 43+ checks | YES | Enterprise quality day 1 |
| **49 Cursor Agents** | Working | YES | Dev team equivalent |
| **i18n (4 languages)** | Complete | Partial | DACH + international |
| **Stripe Connect** | Ready | Partial | Payments built-in |
| **Ivoris Knowledge** | Proven | YES | Dental PVS expertise |
| **7+ Years Experience** | Proven | Partial | Exceeds requirement |
| **Enterprise Background** | Proven | Partial | QA, MLOps, security |

### Asset-to-Value Mapping

| Asset | What It Saves Clinero | Equivalent Value |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| OutrePilot | 6-12 months dev time | €150-300k (3-5 devs × 6 months) |
| OutreRalph | 80% feature delivery time | €100k/year productivity |
| Quality Gates | QA team + tech debt | €50k/year |
| Multi-tenant | Architecture work | €30-50k |
| Ivoris Knowledge | Research + mistakes | €20-30k |
| **TOTAL** | | **€350-530k value** |

### Leverage Justification Table

| If You Ask For... | Justify With... | Script |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| €80k salary | 7+ years, exceeds requirement | "I exceed your 4-6 year requirement" |
| 15% equity | First tech hire, building the product | "I'm not employee #10, I'm building it" |
| 8% for OutrePilot | €100k+ replacement cost | "This saves 6+ months of development" |
| 6-month cliff | Common for founding team | "Standard for early-stage key hires" |
| Acceleration clause | You're taking significant risk | "I'm betting my career on this" |

---

## Dimension 3: External Position (The Ask)

### Position Mapping by Scenario

| Scenario | Internal Need | Asset Justification | External Ask |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Max values speed** | €66k minimum | OutreRalph = 10x faster | Model D: €60k + 18% |
| **Max is cash-poor** | Can survive on €48k | Full platform value | Model A: €48k + 20% |
| **Max values stability** | €70k comfortable | Enterprise quality | Model B: €90k + 5% |
| **Max wants alignment** | €66k + upside | Revenue drives both | Model C: €66k + 10% + 3% rev |

### The Negotiation Positions

| Position | Salary | Equity | What You're Saying |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Opening** | €85k | 15-18% | "I bring founder-level value" |
| **Target** | €75k | 12-15% | "Fair for building the product" |
| **Acceptable** | €70k | 10% | "Minimum for this opportunity" |
| **Walk Away** | <€65k | <8% | "Not worth the risk" |

---

## The BATNA Analysis (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)

### Your BATNA

| Alternative | Probability | Value | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Stay at current job | High | Known salary | Safe but no equity upside |
| Other startup offers | ? | Varies | Need to actively pursue |
| Freelance/consulting | Medium | €80-120/hr | No equity, project-based |
| Build own product | Medium | €0 short-term | Full ownership, full risk |
| Different Clinero role | Low | ? | Fallback if main negotiation fails |

**Your BATNA Strength:** ⬜ Weak / ⬜ Medium / ⬜ Strong
(Fill this in based on your actual alternatives)

### Clinero's BATNA

| Alternative | Probability | Cost | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|------|-------|
| Hire different dev | Medium | €60-90k + time | 3-6 months to find + onboard |
| Build in-house slowly | High | 6-12 months delay | No one has OutrePilot |
| Outsource development | Medium | €100-150k | Lower quality, vendor lock-in |
| Pivot strategy | Low | Unknown | Different business model |
| Continue with prototype | High | Tech debt | Current path but limited |

**Clinero's BATNA Strength:** Medium-Weak
- No technical co-founder
- 6 months old, need to move fast
- Prototypes exist but need production quality
- You've already impressed Max (call went well)

        Day      (Day 17)   (Days 18-21)  Signing
```

## Leverage Windows

| Phase | Your Leverage | Their Urgency | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Before Trial** | Medium | Low | Prepare, don't negotiate |
| **Trial Day** | Building | Medium | Impress, get feature request |
| **Post-Demo Delivery** | **MAXIMUM** | **HIGH** | This is your moment |
| **Negotiation Week** | High→Medium | High | Use momentum |
| **After Signing** | Low | Low | Leverage spent |

## Urgency Signals to Watch

| Signal | Interpretation | Your Move |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| "We need to move fast" | They have deadline/investors | Maintain leverage, don't rush |
| "Take your time to decide" | Confident or bluffing | Test with counter-offer |
| "We have other candidates" | Pressure tactic or real | Ask for specifics |
| "Investors want tech lead" | External pressure | High leverage |
| "Let's start next week" | Very urgent | Can push for more |

## Negotiation Sequence Strategy

**Order matters.** Research shows early agreements create momentum.

### Recommended Sequence

| Order | Topic | Why This Order |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | **Role & Title** | Easy yes, builds momentum |
| 2 | **Responsibilities** | Defines scope before compensation |
| 3 | **Salary Range** | Anchor before equity discussion |
| 4 | **Equity Percentage** | After salary establishes your value |
| 5 | **OutrePilot License** | Separate value, separate negotiation |
| 6 | **Vesting Terms** | Technical details after big picture |
| 7 | **Protection Clauses** | End with mutual protection |

### What to Negotiate First vs Last

| Negotiate Early | Negotiate Later | Never Rush |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Role clarity | Specific numbers | Written agreement |
| Mutual fit | Vesting details | Bad Leaver definition |
| General compensation range | Acceleration | Start date (if pressured) |

## Time Pressure Tactics (Recognize & Counter)

| Their Tactic | What They're Doing | Your Counter |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "We need an answer by Friday" | Creating artificial deadline | "I appreciate the urgency. Let me review properly and come back Monday." |
| "The equity pool is limited" | Scarcity pressure | "Then let's make sure we get my allocation right." |
| "We're talking to other candidates" | Competition pressure | "I understand. I want to make sure we're both making the right decision." |
| "This offer expires" | Forcing quick decision | "A good decision is better than a fast one. Let's extend by 48 hours." |

---

# Extension 2: Concession Strategy

## The Concession Ladder

**Principle:** Never give without getting. Every concession should unlock value.

### Your Concession Currency (What You Can Give)

| Concession | Value to Them | Cost to You | When to Use |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Accept lower salary | Cash saved | Income reduction | If equity increases proportionally |
| Accept 12-month cliff (vs 6) | More commitment | Higher risk | If acceleration clause added |
| Start sooner | Time saved | Less prep | If terms are finalized |
| Reduce equity ask by 2-3% | Less dilution | Upside reduction | If salary increases |
| License OutrePilot non-exclusively | Options for them | IP protection | If struggling on equity |

### What to Get in Return (Trade-offs)

| If You Give... | Ask for... | Justification |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Lower salary | Higher equity | "I'm betting on us" |
| 12-month cliff | 6-month acceleration if fired | "Balanced protection" |
| Earlier start | Signing bonus | "Transitioning quickly has costs" |
| Reduced equity | Revenue share | "Aligned incentives instead" |
| Non-exclusive OutrePilot | Immediate equity (no vesting) | "IP value is delivered day 1" |

### Concession Rules

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Never concede first** | Let them identify what they want |
| **Never concede alone** | Always link to a get |
| **Concede slowly** | Small moves signal limit approaching |
| **Concede reluctantly** | Show it costs you something |
| **Document concessions** | "So we agreed that if I... you would..." |

### Concession Pattern

```
You: "I'd like €80k and 15%"
Max: "That's too high. We can do €70k and 10%"
You: "I understand budget constraints. If we're at €70k,
      I'd need the equity closer to 12% to make it work."
Max: "12% is possible if we do standard 12-month cliff"
You: "I can accept 12-month cliff if we add 6-month
      acceleration in case of termination without cause."
Max: "That's reasonable."

Result: €70k + 12% + 12-month cliff + acceleration
(vs. €80k + 15% ask, but with protection added)
```

### Your Pre-Planned Concessions

| Priority | Your Position | First Fallback | Final Fallback |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Salary | €80k | €75k | €70k (floor: €65k) |
| Equity (work) | 12% | 10% | 8% (floor) |
| Equity (OutrePilot) | 8% | 5% | 3% (if non-exclusive) |
| Cliff | 6 months | 9 months | 12 months (with acceleration) |
| Acceleration | 12 months | 6 months | Must have something |

# Extension 3: Interest Mapping (Max's Perspective)

## Interest vs Position

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Position** | What they SAY they want | "5% equity max" |
| **Interest** | WHY they want it | "Preserve ownership for investors" |

**Key Insight:** Positions conflict. Interests can be aligned.

## Max's Likely Interests

### Business Interests

| Interest | Evidence | How to Address |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Ship product fast** | 15 clients waiting | "OutrePilot enables rapid delivery" |
| **Maintain quality** | Job posting mentions "stable operation" | "Enterprise quality from day 1" |
| **Keep costs manageable** | Early-stage, €25k capital | "Lower salary + higher equity works for me" |
| **Preserve equity for investors** | Future fundraising | "My equity is earned, not dilutive" |
| **Technical credibility** | No tech co-founder | "I bring enterprise background" |

### Personal Interests

| Interest | Evidence | How to Address |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Find someone trustworthy** | First key hire | Build relationship, be transparent |
| **Not get screwed** | Solo founder risk | "Fair to both sides" framing |
| **Keep control** | Sole founder | "You're the CEO, I'm the CTO" |
| **Look good to clients** | 15 clients | "I'll represent Clinero well" |
| **Move fast** | Startup urgency | "I can start [date]" |

### Fear Interests (What He Wants to Avoid)

| Fear | How It Manifests | Your Counter |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Overpaying | Resists high numbers | Show value in saved time/cost |
| Hiring wrong person | Trial day exists | Welcome the evaluation |
| Losing control | Cautious on equity | "You're the business lead" |
| Tech person leaving | Vesting structure | Accept reasonable vesting |
| Investor dilution | Caps equity offers | Frame your equity as investment |

## Interest-Based Negotiation Tactics

### Reframe Positions as Interests

| Max Says (Position) | His Interest | Your Response |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| "5% is the maximum" | Preserve cap table | "I understand. What if we structure part as performance milestone unlocks?" |
