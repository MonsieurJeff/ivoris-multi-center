## Round 1 Questions (Answered 2026-01-17)

### Your Situation

| # | Question | Your Answer | Implication |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.1 | If Max offers 5% equity max, would you accept? | **Depends on salary trade-off** | Need acceptance grid |
| 1.2 | If Max says "no written agreement until 6 months in", what do you do? | **Push back hard, but negotiate** | Not a hard walk-away |
| 1.3 | If demo doesn't impress Max, do you still want to join? | **Yes, still interested** | Demo is leverage, not decision |
| 1.4 | Would you accept €50k salary if equity is 20%? | **Context-dependent** | See acceptance matrix |
| 1.5 | If Max is evasive about financials, do you proceed? | TBD | |

### Factors That Make Lower Offers Acceptable

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ CTO title immediately | Worth ~2-3% equity equivalent |
| ✅ OutrePilot valued separately | Worth 5-8% extra |
| ✅ Clear milestones for equity increase | Worth ~2% now for 5% later |
| ✅ Revenue share | Worth variable upside |

---

## Multi-Dimensional Acceptance Matrix

### Base Grid: Salary vs Equity

| Equity ↓ / Salary → | €50k | €55k | €60k | €65k | €70k | €80k |
|---------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **18%+** | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **15%** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **12%** | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **10%** | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️* | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **8%** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️* | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **5%** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️* |

**Legend:** ✅ Accept | ⚠️ Conditional | ⚠️* Needs extras | ❌ Reject

### Conditional Acceptance (⚠️ cells become ✅ if...)

| Cell | Becomes ✅ If... |
|------|------------------|
| €50k + 18% | + CTO title OR + written agreement |
| €55k + 15% | + OutrePilot valued OR + milestones |
| €60k + 10-12% | + CTO + milestones |
| €65k + 8-10% | + CTO + OutrePilot + revenue share |
| €80k + 5% | + CTO + OutrePilot + clear path to 10%+ |

### Absolute Floors (Decided)

| Type | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| **Salary floor** | €55k (survival + buffer) |
| **Equity floor** | 8% (meaningful ownership) |
| **Combined floor** | €55k + 10% OR €60k + 8% |
| **With all extras** | €50k + 8% + CTO + milestones + OutrePilot |

---

## Revised Walk-Away Conditions

Based on Round 1 answers, your walk-aways are **softer than initially stated**:

| Condition | Original | Revised |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| No written agreement | WALK AWAY | **Push back hard, negotiate** |
| Below €65k salary | Walk away | **Accept if equity >12%** |
| Below 8% equity | Walk away | **Accept if salary >€80k + CTO** |

### True Non-Negotiables (Discovered)

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Some form of written commitment | Need clarity, but timing negotiable |
| Path to meaningful ownership | Either now or via milestones |
| OutrePilot ownership protected | License OK, transfer NOT OK |
| CTO path must be real | Vague promises not acceptable |

---

## Scenario Testing Questions (Answered)

| # | Question | Your Answer | Implication |
|---|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.5 | If Max is evasive about financials? | **Red flag - reconsider** | Transparency matters |
| 1.6 | Best case: Ideal offer? | **€70k + 15% + CTO + OutrePilot bonus** | Clear ceiling |
| 1.7 | Worst acceptable: Minimum? | See matrix above | Floor defined |
| 1.8 | Red line: Walk away no matter what? | See below | True non-negotiables |
| 1.9 | If Clinero fails in 2 years? | **All: dental expertise + CTO + salary** | Downside covered |
| 1.10 | If Clinero succeeds hugely? | Building the product, bringing OutrePilot | Upside justified |

---

## TRUE Red Lines (Discovered in Round 1)

These make you walk away **regardless of other terms**:

| Red Line | Why It's Absolute |
|----------|-------------------|
| ❌ **Transfer OutrePilot ownership** | IP protection is fundamental |
| ❌ **No path to CTO** (stay "engineer" forever) | Career growth essential |
| ❌ **Dishonesty/manipulation from Max** | Trust is foundation |

### Comparison: Soft vs Hard Limits

| Item | Type | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Written agreement timing | SOFT | Negotiate |
| Salary below €60k | SOFT | Accept if equity high |
| Equity below 10% | SOFT | Accept if salary/extras high |
| Transparency evasion | MEDIUM | Red flag, reconsider |
| OutrePilot ownership transfer | **HARD** | Walk away |
| No CTO path | **HARD** | Walk away |
| Dishonesty | **HARD** | Walk away |

```

---

## Scenario A: Strong Offer

**Definition:** Max offers close to your ideal (€65-80k + 12-18% + CTO path)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | "We'd like to offer you €70k, 12% equity with CTO path..." |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Your Feeling** | Excited but verify details |
| **Red Flags to Check** | Vesting terms, Bad Leaver, written agreement |

### Response Strategy

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Acknowledge | "That sounds like a strong starting point." |
| 2. Clarify | "Let me understand the structure..." |
| 3. Negotiate | Push for OutrePilot bonus (extra 3-5%) |
| 4. Protect | Ensure written agreement, clear leaver terms |
| 5. Accept | If protections are in place |

### Script (DE)

> "Das klingt nach einem guten Ausgangspunkt. Bevor ich zusage, möchte ich die Struktur verstehen - besonders Vesting, Leaver-Regelungen, und wie wir das schriftlich festhalten. Außerdem bringe ich OutrePilot mit, das wir separat bewerten sollten."

---

## Scenario B: Standard Offer

**Definition:** Typical startup offer (€60-70k + 8-10% + vague CTO path)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | "We can offer €65k and 8% equity, with growth potential..." |
| **Probability** | 40% (most likely) |
| **Your Feeling** | Acceptable base, needs improvement |
| **Gap to Close** | Equity +2-4%, CTO clarity, OutrePilot value |

### Response Strategy

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Acknowledge | "I appreciate the offer. Let me share my perspective." |
| 2. Reframe | "My priority is ownership - I'm flexible on salary if equity is higher." |
| 3. Introduce | "I'm also bringing OutrePilot, which has separate value." |
| 4. Counter | Push to €65k + 12% OR €60k + 15% |
| 5. Protect | Require written agreement, acceleration clause |

### Script (DE)

> "Danke für das Angebot. Meine Priorität ist tatsächlich Beteiligung - ich bin bereit, beim Gehalt flexibel zu sein, wenn die Equity stimmt. Ich würde vorschlagen: €65k mit 12%, oder €60k mit 15%. Außerdem bringe ich OutrePilot mit, das wir als separaten Wert besprechen sollten."

---

## Scenario C: Low Ball Offer

**Definition:** Below your floor (€50-60k + 5-8% + unclear path)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | "We're early stage, so we can offer €55k and 5%..." |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Your Feeling** | Disappointed, need to push hard or consider walking |
| **Gap to Close** | Major - need 2x equity or significant extras |

### Response Strategy

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Don't React Negatively | Stay calm, don't show disappointment |
| 2. Clarify | "Help me understand how you arrived at these numbers." |
| 3. Reframe Value | "I'm not employee #10 - I'm building the product as first tech hire." |
| 4. Counter Strongly | "For this role, I'd need at least €60k + 12%, or €55k + 15% with milestones." |
| 5. Decision | If no movement → consider walking |

### Script (DE)

> "Ich verstehe, dass ihr noch am Anfang seid. Aber ich möchte betonen: Ich bin nicht ein normaler Mitarbeiter. Ich bin der erste technische Hire, ohne Tech-Mitgründer, und ich baue das Produkt auf. Das ist eine andere Kategorie. Für diese Rolle bräuchte ich mindestens €60k mit 12%, oder wir können über niedrigeres Gehalt mit höherer Beteiligung sprechen."

### Decision Point

| If Max... | Then... |
|-----------|---------|
| Moves significantly (€60k + 10%+) | Continue negotiation |
| Moves slightly (€58k + 7%) | Ask for extras (CTO, milestones, OutrePilot) |
| Doesn't move | "I need to think about this" → consider walking |

---

## Scenario D: Red Flag Behavior

**Definition:** Max triggers one of your true walk-aways

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | See red flag list below |
| **Probability** | 10% |
| **Your Feeling** | Disappointed but clear |
| **Action** | Exit gracefully |

### Red Flag Triggers

| Red Flag | Example Quote | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Wants OutrePilot ownership** | "If you bring it, it becomes company property" | Walk away |
| **No CTO path** | "We'll always have you as senior engineer" | Walk away |
| **Dishonesty detected** | Contradicts previous statements, evasive | Walk away |
| **Hostile to written agreement** | "If you don't trust us, maybe this isn't right" | Walk away |

### Exit Script (DE)

> "Ich schätze die Zeit und das Gespräch. Aber ich glaube, wir haben unterschiedliche Vorstellungen von der Zusammenarbeit. Ich wünsche euch viel Erfolg mit Clinero."

### Exit Script (EN)

> "I appreciate the time and conversation. But I think we have different expectations for the collaboration. I wish you success with Clinero."

---

## Scenario E: Wildcard Offer

**Definition:** Unexpected structure (revenue share, milestone equity, joint venture)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | "What if we structured it differently..." |
| **Probability** | 5% |
| **Your Feeling** | Curious, need to evaluate carefully |
| **Action** | Take time to analyze |

### Possible Wildcards

| Wildcard | Your Response |
|----------|---------------|
| Revenue share instead of equity | Evaluate: could be better or worse |
| Milestone-based equity (2% now, 10% if targets hit) | Could work if milestones are fair |
| OutrePilot joint venture | Interesting - evaluate carefully |
| Lower now, review in 6 months | Risky without written commitment |

### Response Strategy

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Listen | Don't react immediately |
| 2. Clarify | "That's interesting. Help me understand how it would work." |
| 3. Time | "I'd like to think about this structure. Can I come back tomorrow?" |
| 4. Analyze | Model the numbers, compare to standard offers |
| 5. Decide | Based on analysis |

---

---

## Scenario F: Partnership/Co-Founder Offer

**Definition:** Max offers co-founder role, not employee

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | "What if you came in as co-founder/technical partner?" |
| **Probability** | 10-15% (Max is sole founder, might want partner) |
| **Your Feeling** | Very interesting, but higher stakes |
| **Key Questions** | Equity split, decision rights, liability, exit terms |

### What Co-Founder Means

| Aspect | Employee | Co-Founder |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Equity | 10-20% (vested) | 25-49% (immediate or fast vest) |
| Salary | Market rate | Often lower (€40-60k) or deferred |
| Decision Rights | Advisory | Voting/veto on key decisions |
| Liability | None | Potentially shared |
| Exit | Leave anytime | Complicated, need shareholders agreement |
| Title | CTO (eventually) | CTO/Co-Founder |

### Questions to Ask

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "What equity split are you thinking?" | 50/50? 60/40? 70/30? |
| "How would decision-making work?" | Veto rights? Domains? |
| "What salary would co-founders take?" | Both take same? Market rate? |
| "What if one of us wants to leave?" | Buy-out terms, vesting |
| "How would OutrePilot fit?" | Company asset or licensed? |

### Response Strategy

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Explore | "That's interesting. Tell me more about how you see it." |
| 2. Clarify | Ask the questions above |
| 3. Compare | Is this better than employee + 15-20% equity? |
| 4. Time | "This is a bigger decision. Let me think about it." |
| 5. Legal | Would need lawyer review of shareholders agreement |

### Script (DE)

> "Das ist ein interessanter Vorschlag. Ich würde gerne verstehen, wie du dir das vorstellst - Equity-Aufteilung, Entscheidungsfindung, Gehalt, und was passiert, wenn einer von uns gehen möchte. Das wäre eine größere Entscheidung als ein Angestelltenverhältnis."

### Decision Framework

| If Partnership Offers... | Compare To... | Decision |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------|
| 30% + €50k + equal voice | Employee 15% + €70k | Partnership might be better |
| 20% + €40k + Max controls | Employee 15% + €70k | Employee is better |
| 40% + €60k + clear domains | Employee 20% + €65k | Partnership is better |

### Key Risk: OutrePilot

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OutrePilot becomes "company asset" | Explicitly license, don't transfer |
| Harder to leave if it fails | Clear exit terms in shareholders agreement |
| More liability | Limit liability in agreement |
