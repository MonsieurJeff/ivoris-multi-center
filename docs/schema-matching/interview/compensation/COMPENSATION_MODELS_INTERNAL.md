| Type | When You Can Use It |

**Warning:** Equity is worth €0 if company fails or never exits.

### Why It's Valuable to Clinero

| Clinero Need (Job Posting) | OutrePilot Delivers |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| "Applikation-Layer weiterentwickeln" | Ready application layer |
| "spezialisierte Agenten für Abrechnungsfälle" | Agentic framework for specialized agents |
| "90% Automatisierung stabil im Betrieb" | Enterprise stability built-in |

| "Multi-Tenant-Fähigkeit" | Multi-tenant architecture |
| "Schnelles Shippen ohne Qualität zu verlieren" | CI/CD, quality gates, enterprise standards |

### License Options

| Option | You Keep | Clinero Gets | Equity Value |

| **Exclusive License (Dental)** | Ownership, use outside dental | Exclusive dental/healthcare rights | 8-12% |
| **Non-Exclusive License** | Full rights everywhere | Right to use (not exclusive) | 3-5% |

### Recommended: Fork License

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **You retain** | 100% ownership of OutrePilot |
| **Clinero receives** | Full copy (fork) with right to modify |

| Time-to-Market | 3-6 months saved × burn rate | €75,000 - €150,000 |

It could accelerate Clinero's development significantly. I want to keep ownership, but I'm open to licensing you a full copy that you can modify. How could we structure this as part of my equity package?" |
| **DE** | "Ich habe OutrePilot in den letzten Monaten gebaut - eine moderne Agentic Enterprise Platform mit LLMOps, RAG, Governance und Enterprise Security. Das könnte Clineros Entwicklung deutlich beschleunigen. Ich möchte Eigentümer bleiben, bin aber offen, euch eine vollständige Kopie zu lizenzieren, die ihr anpassen könnt. Wie könnten wir das als Teil meiner Beteiligung strukturieren?" |

## Risk Analysis

| Model | If Company Fails | If Status Quo | If Excellent |
|-------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| A | Lost €42k/year in salary | Decent, equity low value | Massive upside |
| B | Minimal loss, market salary | Good, stable income | Limited upside |
| C | Lost €24k/year + lost rev% | Good balance | Strong upside |
| D | Lost €30k/year, IP gone | Decent, IP provides buffer | Massive upside |

---

## Recommendation

### If you believe in Clinero's success: Model A or D
- Maximum upside potential
- Accept lower salary for ownership
- Model D if OutrePilot IP is valued

### If you're uncertain: Model C
- Balanced approach
- Revenue share provides immediate alignment
- Moderate equity for upside

### If you need security: Model B
- Market-rate salary
- Equity is bonus, not core compensation
- Lower risk, lower reward

---

## Negotiation Strategy

### Your Strengths to Emphasize

| Strength | How to Use It |
|----------|---------------|
| 7+ years experience | "I exceed your 4-6 year requirement" |
| Enterprise background | "I've built QA frameworks, MLOps pipelines at scale" |
| OutrePilot | "I bring a ready platform, not just skills" |
| Ivoris project | "I already understand dental PVS complexity" |
| Reference letter | "My previous CEO recommends me nachdrücklich" |

### Open with:
- Express interest in partnership, not just employment
- State preference for aligned incentives (equity + performance)
- Mention OutrePilot as potential contribution

### Ask for:
- Full transparency on cap table and financials
- Clear definition of performance metrics
- Written vesting agreement

### Be prepared for:
- Max offering lower equity (3-5%)
- Vesting terms negotiation
- Discussion of OutrePilot valuation if Model D

### Walk-away point:
- Below €70k salary with less than 5% equity
- No transparency on financials
- No clear CTO path

---

## Protection Mechanisms (CRITICAL)

### The Risk You Identified

| Risk | Reality |
|------|---------|
| They use your knowledge | You build systems, train team, establish architecture |
| They end partnership | After 11 months (before cliff) or anytime after |
| You're left with nothing | No equity vested, no severance, knowledge transferred |

**This happens. It's not paranoia - it's business reality.**

---

### Protection 1: Vesting Terms (Non-Negotiable)

| Term | Standard | What You Need | Why |
|------|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Cliff** | 1 year | 6 months OR partial cliff | 12 months is too long to risk |
| **Vesting schedule** | Monthly after cliff | Monthly after cliff | Don't accept quarterly/annual |
| **Good Leaver** | Keep vested equity | Explicit definition | Must be in writing |
| **Bad Leaver** | Lose everything | Only for gross misconduct | NOT for "performance" |

**Ask Max:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Was passiert mit meinen gevested Anteilen, wenn wir uns trennen? Gibt es einen Good Leaver/Bad Leaver Unterschied?" | "What happens to my vested shares if we part ways? Is there a Good Leaver/Bad Leaver distinction?" |

---

### Protection 2: Acceleration Clause (IMPORTANT)

**Single Trigger Acceleration:** If you're terminated without cause, some/all unvested equity accelerates.

| Scenario | Without Protection | With Protection |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fired at month 11 | 0% equity | 25% accelerates (1 year worth) |
| Fired at month 18 | 3.75% (vested) | 7.5% (vested + 6 months acceleration) |
| Company sold, you're out | Only vested | 50-100% accelerates |

**What to ask for:**
- **Single trigger:** 6-12 months acceleration if terminated without cause
- **Double trigger:** 50-100% acceleration if company sold AND you're let go

**Script:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Was passiert mit meinen Anteilen, wenn ihr mich ohne wichtigen Grund kündigt? Gibt es eine Acceleration-Klausel?" | "What happens to my shares if you terminate me without cause? Is there an acceleration clause?" |

---

### Protection 3: Severance Terms

| Situation | Standard | What to Ask For |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Fired without cause | Nothing | 3-6 months salary |
| Mutual separation | Nothing | 1-3 months salary |
| Fired for cause | Nothing | Definition must be specific |

**"For cause" must be specific:**
- Fraud, theft, gross misconduct = legitimate
- "Poor performance" = too vague, reject this
- "Not a good fit" = too vague, reject this

---

### Protection 4: OutrePilot License Terms

**If you license OutrePilot, protect yourself:**

| Scenario | Without Protection | With Protection |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| You're fired | They keep using OutrePilot forever | License terminates or buyout required |
| Company sold | New owners use your IP | License fee or equity in sale proceeds |
| They modify and resell | You get nothing | Derivative works clause protects you |

**License terms to include:**
1. **Termination clause:** If employment ends, license continues only if equity was fairly vested
2. **Buyout option:** If they want to keep using after you leave, they pay fair value
3. **Derivative works:** Their modifications don't give them ownership of core OutrePilot
4. **Non-compete carve-out:** You can still use OutrePilot for non-dental markets

---

### Protection 5: Non-Compete Limitations

**German law limits non-competes, but be careful:**

| Term | Acceptable | Not Acceptable |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Duration | 6-12 months max | 2+ years |
| Scope | Dental billing automation | "AI" or "healthcare" broadly |
| Geography | Germany or DACH | Worldwide |
| Compensation | 50% of salary during non-compete | No compensation |

**In Germany:** Non-compete without compensation is generally unenforceable, but get it in writing.

---

### Protection 6: Written Agreement Before Starting

**NEVER start without:**

| Document | What It Must Include |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Employment contract** | Salary, title, responsibilities |
| **Equity agreement (Beteiligungsvertrag)** | %, vesting, cliff, good/bad leaver, acceleration |
| **OutrePilot license (if applicable)** | Terms, termination conditions |
| **IP assignment clause** | What you create belongs to company, EXCEPT OutrePilot |

**Red flag:** "We'll figure out the equity details later" = NO

---

### Worst Case Scenarios

| Scenario | What Happens | Your Protection |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Fired at month 11 | Lose all equity | 6-month cliff OR acceleration clause |
| Fired at month 18, "performance" | They claim Bad Leaver | Specific Bad Leaver definition |
| Company sold at month 24 | New owners don't want you | Double trigger acceleration |
| They copy OutrePilot to new product | You get nothing | License agreement with derivative clause |
| Max brings in new CTO | You're demoted/pushed out | CTO path in writing, acceleration if role changes |

---

### What You Keep No Matter What

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Salary earned** | Yours - paid monthly |
| **Vested equity** | Yours - if Good Leaver terms are clear |
| **OutrePilot ownership** | Yours - you only license, never transfer |
| **Experience & knowledge** | Yours - can't be taken |
| **Reference potential** | Depends on relationship |
| **Network contacts** | Yours |

---

### Fair to Both Sides

Your goal of being fair works both ways:

| Fair to You | Fair to Them |
|-------------|--------------|
| Protection if let go | Cliff period to prove yourself |
| Keep vested equity | Bad leaver clause for misconduct |
| Acceleration if terminated without cause | Vesting over time for commitment |
| OutrePilot remains yours | License to use and modify |
| Severance if fired | No severance if you quit |

**Frame it to Max:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Ich möchte, dass wir beide geschützt sind. Du brauchst Sicherheit, dass ich committed bin - deshalb akzeptiere ich Vesting. Ich brauche Sicherheit, dass meine Beiträge respektiert werden - deshalb brauche ich klare Leaver-Regelungen." | "I want us both to be protected. You need security that I'm committed - that's why I accept vesting. I need security that my contributions are respected - that's why I need clear leaver terms." |

## Diplomatic Presentation Guide

### My Guiding Principle (Internal - Not a Script)

**Why I want a contract:**

> I love the principle behind contracts: everything should be clear and transparent. A good contract doesn't mean distrust - it means we both know exactly where we stand. That creates the foundation for real collaboration.

**This guides my approach:**
- I'm not asking for protection because I'm suspicious
- I'm asking because clarity prevents conflicts
- A good contract enables trust, not replaces it
- If Max is professional, he'll appreciate this mindset

---

### Core Principle: Partnership, Not Confrontation

| Mindset | How to Express |
|---------|----------------|
| "I don't trust you" | "I want us both protected" |
| "I'm worried you'll fire me" | "Let's be clear about expectations from the start" |
| "What if you screw me over" | "What happens in different scenarios?" |
| "I need protection" | "This is standard for founding team arrangements" |

---

### Opening the Protection Conversation

**When to bring it up:** After discussing compensation, before finalizing.

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Bevor wir die Details finalisieren - ich möchte kurz über die Struktur sprechen. Das ist Standard bei Gründerteam-Vereinbarungen und schützt uns beide." | "Before we finalize the details - I'd like to briefly discuss the structure. This is standard for founding team arrangements and protects us both." |

---

### Question-by-Question Diplomatic Scripts

#### Q15: Good Leaver / Bad Leaver

| Approach | Script |
|----------|--------|
| **Wrong** | "Was passiert, wenn ihr mich rauswerft?" |
| **Right** | "Wie sind die Leaver-Regelungen strukturiert? Das ist ja üblich bei Beteiligungsvereinbarungen." |

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Bei Vesting gibt es ja normalerweise Good Leaver/Bad Leaver Regelungen. Wie würdet ihr das strukturieren?" | "With vesting, there are usually Good Leaver/Bad Leaver provisions. How would you structure that?" |

**If Max asks why:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Das ist Standard - es schützt die Firma vor jemandem, der nach 3 Monaten geht, und schützt mich, falls sich unsere Wege aus anderen Gründen trennen." | "It's standard - it protects the company from someone who leaves after 3 months, and protects me if our paths separate for other reasons." |

---

#### Q16: Acceleration Clause

| Approach | Script |
|----------|--------|
| **Wrong** | "Was wenn ihr mich grundlos feuert?" |
| **Right** | "Wie handhaben wir Termination ohne wichtigen Grund?" |

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Falls wir uns trennen und es keinen wichtigen Grund gibt - wie würde das mit den unvested Anteilen funktionieren? Manche Vereinbarungen haben eine Acceleration-Klausel." | "If we part ways and there's no cause - how would that work with the unvested shares? Some agreements have an acceleration clause." |

**Normalize it:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Das ist besonders relevant bei Early-Stage Startups, wo sich die Situation schnell ändern kann - Pivot, neue Investoren mit anderen Vorstellungen, etc." | "This is especially relevant in early-stage startups where the situation can change quickly - pivot, new investors with different ideas, etc." |

---

#### Q17: Definition of "Cause"

| Approach | Script |
|----------|--------|
| **Wrong** | "Was wenn ihr behauptet ich hab schlecht performed?" |
| **Right** | "Was zählt genau als 'wichtiger Grund'?" |

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Bei Bad Leaver - was wäre die Definition von 'wichtigem Grund'? Ich gehe davon aus, wir reden von Betrug oder grober Pflichtverletzung, nicht von subjektiven Dingen wie 'Performance', richtig?" | "For Bad Leaver - what would be the definition of 'cause'? I assume we're talking about fraud or gross misconduct, not subjective things like 'performance', right?" |

**Frame as mutual:**
| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Das schützt auch dich - wenn die Definition klar ist, gibt es später keinen Streit darüber." | "This protects you too - if the definition is clear, there's no dispute about it later." |

---

#### Q18: Written Agreement

| Approach | Script |
|----------|--------|
| **Wrong** | "Ich unterschreibe nichts ohne Beteiligungsvertrag" |
| **Right** | "Wann können wir das formalisieren?" |

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Ich würde vorschlagen, dass wir das alles schriftlich festhalten, bevor ich anfange. Das ist für uns beide gut - klare Erwartungen von Anfang an." | "I'd suggest we put all this in writing before I start. That's good for both of us - clear expectations from the start." |

---

### If Max Pushes Back

#### "Das ist bei uns nicht üblich"

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Ich verstehe, dass ihr noch am Anfang seid. Aber genau deshalb ist es wichtig, das jetzt richtig zu machen. Später wird es nur komplizierter." | "I understand you're still early stage. But that's exactly why it's important to do this right now. Later it only gets more complicated." |

---

#### "Vertraust du mir nicht?"

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Es geht nicht um Vertrauen - ich vertraue dir. Es geht darum, professionell zu sein. Die besten Partnerschaften haben klare Vereinbarungen, gerade weil sie sich vertrauen." | "It's not about trust - I trust you. It's about being professional. The best partnerships have clear agreements, precisely because they trust each other." |

---

#### "Das können wir später regeln"

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Das verstehe ich, aber Equity-Vereinbarungen später zu machen ist immer schwieriger. Wenn wir erfolgreich sind, sind die Anteile mehr wert und die Verhandlung schwieriger. Lass uns das jetzt klären, solange wir beide noch neutral sind." | "I understand, but doing equity agreements later is always harder. If we're successful, the shares are worth more and the negotiation is harder. Let's clarify this now, while we're both still neutral." |

---

#### "Wir haben noch keinen Anwalt/Notar"

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Kein Problem - wir können die Grundzüge jetzt besprechen und dann gemeinsam einen Anwalt hinzuziehen. Ich kann auch bei den Formulierungen helfen, ich hab das schon mal gemacht." | "No problem - we can discuss the basics now and then bring in a lawyer together. I can also help with the wording, I've done this before." |

---

### Red Flags in Max's Responses

| What He Says | What It Might Mean | Your Response |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "Wir regeln das mit Handschlag" | No intention to formalize | "Ich schätze das Vertrauen, aber lass uns trotzdem was schriftliches machen - das ist für alle Beteiligten besser." |
| "Du bist doch wie ein Gründer, nicht wie ein Angestellter" | Founder responsibility without founder protection | "Genau - und Gründer haben Beteiligungsverträge." |
| "Performance ist natürlich ein Grund" | Vague Bad Leaver clause | "Können wir das präzisieren? 'Performance' ist sehr subjektiv." |
| Wird nervös/defensiv | Might not have thought this through OR has bad intentions | Proceed with caution, but don't accuse - stay factual |
| "Das ist ja alles sehr negativ" | Sees protection as distrust | "Im Gegenteil - das zeigt, dass ich langfristig denke. Ich will das richtig aufsetzen, weil ich langfristig dabei sein will." |

---

### Green Flags in Max's Responses

| What He Says | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Gute Frage, lass uns das besprechen" | Open to discussion |
| "Das haben wir noch nicht definiert, aber sollten wir" | Acknowledges importance |
| "Ich schick dir einen Entwurf vom Anwalt" | Takes it seriously |
| "Was wäre für dich fair?" | Willing to negotiate |
| "Das ist Standard, kein Problem" | Experienced/professional |

---

### Closing the Protection Discussion

| DE | EN |
|----|-----|
| "Danke, dass wir das offen besprechen können. Mir ist wichtig, dass wir von Anfang an eine solide Basis haben - dann können wir uns auf das Wichtige konzentrieren: das Produkt bauen." | "Thanks for discussing this openly. It's important to me that we have a solid foundation from the start - then we can focus on what matters: building the product." |

---
