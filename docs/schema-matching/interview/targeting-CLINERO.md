## Your Unique Value Proposition

### The Killer Combo

> "I've spent months deep in Ivoris dental data—487 tables, German column names, BEMA and GOZ billing codes. I've designed a schema matching system specifically for this domain. I understand PATNR, GEBDAT, KASSEN, Karteikarteneintrag. I know the data model."

| "Multi-Tenant-Fähigkeit" | OutrePilot multi-tenant architecture |
| "Schnelles Shippen ohne Qualität zu verlieren" | Three quality gates, automated validation |
| "90% Automatisierung" | 90% auto-match rate target in your design |

## Tailored Talking Points

### Opening (When They Ask About You)

> "I saw your role and it felt like it was written for me. For the past several months, I've been deep in Ivoris dental data—building a schema matching system to automatically map German dental database columns to canonical entities. I know PATNR, GEBDAT, KASSEN, the BEMA and GOZ billing codes. When you talk about 90% automation for billing, I've literally designed a system targeting 90% auto-match rate."

### On Their Scaling Challenge

> "You're at an interesting point—profitable with paying customers, now scaling. That's exactly when architecture decisions matter most. I've built OutrePilot, a multi-tenant governance platform. I understand the difference between 'works for one customer' and 'works for 100 customers.'"

### On LLM Agents in Production

> "I'm focused on production reliability, not notebook demos. My AgentOps framework treats AI agents as capable but supervised junior developers. The key insight: validation scripts are the source of truth, not the agent's self-assessment. For billing automation, that means every decision has an audit trail, confidence scores, and human review for edge cases."

### On Integration Without System Change

> "Your approach—automating in the backend without requiring practices to change systems—is exactly right. My schema matching work solves the same problem: connecting to existing databases, understanding their schema variations, and integrating without forcing migration. I've worked with 15 different Ivoris database variants."
